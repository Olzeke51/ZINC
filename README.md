# ZINC  -  Z is not C

What is it?

ZINC is a mix of:
    FINF- a simple implementation for a FORTH-like language for the Arduino platform. 
    an Arduino program (by - credit here) that is CMD  for a cli
    my code of 'C' based on some OS-type of ideas
    
ZINC initially targets an Arduino Mega2560; that will be an OBD-II reader for my 2002 Blazer.
    It will take the form of a homebrew 'Data-DSKY' - DSKY being the Apollo computer control panel.
    
ZINC will eventually/hopefully be migrated to an ARM based 'Data-DSKY' with expanded capabilities
    utilizing a CoridiumCorp.com product - the 'Datalogger'
    (need to figure out to merge ZINC with their ARMBasic!!)
    
It is free software, released under GNU GPL version 2. [as FINF was also released]
The 'Terminal' will NOT be VT-100 based!!


FINF is not meant to support a significant amount of the standard FORTH library; it is more of a programming exercise than a implementation of a real language and programming environment. It was coded mostly in a couple of hours, with quick tests here and there. Expect it to be unstable and give erroneous results.
  *It failed to compile with the standard Debian download Arduino 2:1.0.5
  It compiled and mostly worked using the Arduino.cc Linux 32bit tar download*
